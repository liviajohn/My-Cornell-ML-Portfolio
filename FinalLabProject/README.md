# HealthyLifeExpectancyModel

**Date**: August 2, 2024

## Overview
This project is part of Lab 8 where the goal is to define and solve a machine learning problem. The chosen problem is predicting "Healthy Life Expectancy at Birth" using various socio-economic indicators from the World Happiness Report 2018 dataset.

## Key Tasks:
1. **Data Preparation**: Loaded and cleaned the World Happiness Report dataset, addressing missing values and scaling features.
2. **Modeling**: Implemented Linear Regression and Random Forest models to predict healthy life expectancy.
3. **Evaluation**: Used RMSE and R² metrics to assess model performance. The Random Forest model outperformed the Linear Regression model with a better generalization capability.

## Results:
- **Linear Regression**: Test RMSE of 3.8664 and R² of 0.7358.
- **Random Forest**: Test RMSE of 2.2803 and R² of 0.9081.

## Conclusion:
The Random Forest model demonstrated superior performance in predicting healthy life expectancy, explaining over 90% of the variance in test data.
